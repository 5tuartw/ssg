# Static Site Generator #
Throughout this project I was able to:
- Learn about what a static site is, and start building the functionality necessary to process and move static HTML and Markdown files.
- Build the core HTML generation logic that will power your static site generator. Use recursion and OOP to build an easily understandable and maintainable system.
- Build the inline markdown parsing logic, and the logic to generate inline HTML elements.
- Handle entire blocks of markdown, and generate the HTML nodes that represent them.
- Put the entire static site generator together, and publish a website.
- Create tests for various stages of the coding process
